Yelp Project - UC Berkeley (Spring 2018)
Developed a visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset after segmenting Berkeley into regions and shading each region by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant.
Visualized which restaurants are close to each other using k-means algorithm to group together restaurants appearing in clusters.
